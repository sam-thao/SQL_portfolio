Sam Thao's SQL Portfolio

Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub repository. Here you'll find a collection of SQL examples that I've developed for solo projects and while working on various data analytics courses, including topics like SQL, machine learning, and more. I've also included some exciting data visualizations created using Tableau. Feel free to explore and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any feedback or questions. Enjoy your visit!
